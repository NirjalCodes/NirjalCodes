### Hey there, fellow code voyager! üëã

Welcome to my little corner of the GitHub universe. I'm NirjalCodes, a 14-year-old aspiring Pythonista, HTML aficionado, and CSS conjurer. Currently on a quest to master the mystical arts of JavaScript and further hone my Python spells.

### About Me:

- üîç Always on the lookout for exciting projects to dive into.
- üå± Currently planting the seeds of knowledge in the fertile soil of JavaScript and Python.
- üí¨ Pronouns: Cod/er | He/Him
- üìß Reach out to summon me at: [nirjalcodes@gmail.com](mailto:nirjalcodes@gmail.com)

### Fun Facts:

- ‚ö° Did you know? My secret ambition is to hack NASA. Just kidding... or am I? üöÄ
