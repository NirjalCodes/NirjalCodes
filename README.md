Hey there, fellow code voyager! 👋
Welcome to my little corner of the GitHub universe. I'm NirjalCodes, a 14-year-old aspiring Pythonista, HTML aficionado, and CSS conjurer. Currently on a quest to master the mystical arts of JavaScript and further hone my Python spells.

Even more prototypes!
DumDum: A whimsical project where animations come to life and mischief ensues.
